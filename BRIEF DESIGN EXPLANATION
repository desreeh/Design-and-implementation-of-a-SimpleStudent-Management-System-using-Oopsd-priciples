1. System Overview

The Student Management System is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system allows creation of student objects, storage of student information,
calculation of grades, and display of student details.
The design consists of four main classes:
Person (Abstract Class)
Course
Student
StudentManagementSystem (Main class)

2. OOP Concepts Demonstrated
A) Encapsulation
Encapsulation is achieved by:
Declaring class attributes as private
Providing public getter and setter methods
For example:
studentId, marks, and course in the Student class are private.
courseCode and courseName in the Course class are private.
This ensures data hiding and controlled access.

B) Abstraction
Abstraction is implemented using the abstract class Person.The method displayDetails() is declared as abstract.It forces subclasses (like Student) to provide their own implementation.
This hides implementation details and provides a clear structure.

C)Inheritance
Inheritance is demonstrated by:
class Student extends Person
The Student class inherits the name attribute and common behavior from the Person class.

D)Polymorphism
Polymorphism is shown through method overriding.The displayDetails() method in the Student class overrides the abstract method defined in Person.
This allows different classes to provide their own implementation of the same method.

3. System Functionality

The system:

Captures Student ID, Name, Course, and Marks

Calculates grade using conditional logic

Displays full student details including calculated grade

The grading criteria used:

Marks	Grade
70+	A
60–69	B
50–59	C
<50	Fail
